INFORMATION ABOUT THE DIPLOMA THESIS TEMPLATE

This template is an update of Maria Czaplicka's 2018 template.

It was created due to the decision No. 109/2021 of the Rector of the Warsaw University of Technology
regulating the content of declarations on authorship and license of the thesis.

Update 27.01.2022 implemented the decision No. 4/2022 of the Rector of the Warsaw University of Technology
and removed obligatory statements and signatures in the text.
Additional title pages were also created and file names were unified. 

Update 14.05.2025 changed university logo in the front page. 

The files that need to be customized are in the folders
    1. title_page
    2. thesis

After creating the cover page, move the PDF file to the 2. thesis folder.
(
 If you give it a name other than titlepage.pdf (titlepage-eng.pdf in the case of the English version)
 you need to adjust the path in the command include a cover page - see files
 thesis_pl.pdf and thesis_eng.tex in folder 2. thesis.
